[Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py)

### Reflection

## Launchpad1

### Assignment Description

this required us to make the computer count down from 10 to 0.

### Evidence 

![launchpad](images/Launchpad.gif)

### Wiring

Not particularly necessary

### Code
[Launchpad!](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/launchpad.py)

### Reflection

This assignment was fairly easy, just requr=iring me to remember some of the basics

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Launchpad2

### Assignment Description

This assignment required us to add a few blinking LEDs to the project to sync with time.

### Evidence

### Code
[Launchpad!](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/launchpad.py)

### Reflection

this one just required me to remember the syntax for LEDs and toss it into the previous work seamlessly.

## Launchpad3

### Assignment Description

this assignment required a button to be integrated and an "abort" function to work with it.

### Evidence

### Wiring

![wiring](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/images/Launchpad.png)

### Code
[Launchpad!](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/launchpad.py)

### Reflection

During this assignment I rewrte my entire code to make it cleaner and simpler to read.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Launchpad4

### Assignment Description

this assignment required us to actuate a servo at the end, or make it move progressively earlier

### Evidence 

![launchpad](images/Launchpad.gif)

### Wiring

![wiring](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/images/Launchpad.png)

### Code

[Launchpad!](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/launchpad.py)

### Reflection

the math for this was kind of a pain, but I was happy that I remembered how to do some of the fancy division logic. I read part of the assignment wrong and so the servo is moving for the wrong amount of time,  but was accepted anyway.

## Accelerometer

### Assignment Description
we had to print the values of the accelerometer to the serial monitor.

### Evidence 

![accelerometer](images/Accelerometer.gif)

### Wiring

![wiring](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/images/AWiring.jpg)

### Code
[Accelerometer](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Accelerometer.py)

### Reflection
this assignment was simple, but the text blob took a little time.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Powerboost

### Assignment Description
We had to light up an LED if it turned 90 degrees and had to make it battery powered

### Evidence 

![accelerometer](images/Accelerometer.gif)

### Wiring

![wiring](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/images/AWiring.jpg)

### Code
[Accelerometer](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Accelerometer.py)

### Reflection
this one just took a little legwork to find out how gravity functioned in relation to slightly off numbers


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## OLED screen

### Assignment Description
we had to make an OLED screen output the numbers instead of the serial monitor

### Evidence 

![accelerometer](images/Accelerometer.gif)

### Wiring

![wiring](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/images/AWiring.jpg)

### Code
[Accelerometer](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Accelerometer.py)

### Reflection
This assignment, I had to get some extra help because it was printing new values over my screen. I fixed it with moving all that to my while true.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Barometer

### Assignment Description
I had to add a barometer that disabled it if it was 3 meters above the starting point

### Evidence 

![accelerometer](images/Accelerometer.gif)

### Wiring

![wiring](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/images/AWiring.jpg)

### Code
[Accelerometer](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Accelerometer.py)

### Reflection
This one was hard. I had to find [an Adafruit tutorial](https://learn.adafruit.com/using-mpl3115a2-with-circuitpython/overview) to complete it. I was starting to struggle to fit the pins, and due to code difficulties, just decided to add an extra sda/scl connection


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Landing Area 1

### Assignment Description
for this assignment, we had to take three points and find the area of the formed triangle.

### Evidence 
![areagif](images/area.gif)


### Wiring
no wires are needed for this assignment


### Code
[Area](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Area.py)

### Reflection
This assignment was painful. Because I had never used a try/except, almost forgot how lists work, and completely forgot heron's formula, this assignment took a while. First, I found Heron's formula and wrote it down. I also made a function with a try/except and took a minute to test for an int. The list part was simple, and I just had to remember listname[0] and listname[1].


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Landing Area 2

### Assignment Description
for this assignment,we had to take all of the information and put it down on an OLED screen.

### Evidence 
![areagif](images/arealed.gif)


### Wiring
![area](images/area.png)


### Code
[Area](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Area.py)

### Reflection
this part was difficult, but I had already done all of the hard things in the previous part, so I just had to establish the integers of my variables and relate the points around the origin.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

##Landing Area 3

### Assignment Description
For this assignment, I had to determine the closest triagnle with an area greater than 100

### Evidence 



### Wiring
![area](images/area.png)


### Code
[Something like this](https://github.com/millerm22/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/Raspberry_Pi/hello_world.py)

### Reflection
this assignment was a slog, but it got finished fairly quickly.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Morse code 1

### Assignment Description
we had to translate words into chunks of morse code

### Evidence 



### Wiring
you don't need any wires for this


### Code
[Morse Code](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/morse.py)

### Reflection
At first, I read the assignment wrong and thought it also wanted an LED, so I coded that second assignment(and finished it) before really focusing on this one.


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Morse Code 2

### Assignment Description
this assignment required us to blink a LED with the morse code.

### Evidence 



### Wiring
![morse](images/morse.png)


### Code
[Morse Code](https://github.com/Ashanks70/Engineering_4_Notebooks/blob/main/raspberry-pi/morse.py)

### Reflection
This assignment was kind of annoying to start, but since I mostly understood how dictionaries work in python, it was a matter of looking for the numerous different mistakes I made


&nbsp;


## Onshape_Assignment_Template

### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. What is the purpose of this assignment? It should be at least a few sentences.

### Part Link 

[Create a link to your Onshape document](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/003e413cee57f7ccccaa15c2/w/ea71050bb283bf3bf088c96c/e/c85ae532263d3b551e1795d0?renderMode=0&uiState=62d9b9d7883c4f335ec42021). Don't forget to turn on link sharing in your Onshape document so that others can see it. 

### Part Image

Take a nice screenshot of your Onshape document. 

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience? Your goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!

## Media Test

Your readme will have various images and gifs on it. Upload a test image and test gif to make sure you've got the process figured out. Pick whatever image and gif you want!
